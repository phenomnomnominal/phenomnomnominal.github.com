<h1>1000 Good Intentions</h1>

<hr/>

<p>Hey, I&#39;m Craig - let&#39;s assume for now that if you&#39;re reading this, you probably know me somehow (and if not, &quot;Hi?&quot;) - and this is going to be my site, and my blog. It&#39;s currently on <a href="https://github.com/phenomnomnominal/phenomnomnominal.github.com"><strong><code>Github</code></strong></a>, but I&#39;ll eventually move it to my own domain, probably...</p>

<p>So, who am I? Excellent question, not really sure. But &quot;<em>what</em> am I?&quot; is probably a bit easier to answer. I&#39;m 24 and I live in Wellington, NZ. By day I work for <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz"><strong><code>Trade Me</code></strong></a> as a front-end dev on <a href="http://touch.trademe.co.nz"><strong><code>Trade Me Touch</code></strong></a>. By night, I pretty much just watch TV.</p>

<p>For now this site is <strong>SUPER</strong> beta. No WebGL, it&#39;s broke. <del>On a mobile? Even more broke</del>. But I&#39;ll get there. If something almost works, but is really broken, please let me know - or better yet, fix it yourself, like I said, it&#39;s all up on <a href="https://github.com/phenomnomnominal/phenomnomnominal.github.com"><strong><code>Github</code></strong></a>.</p>

<p>I guess the theory is that I will write some words and put them up here. They probably won&#39;t be particularly eloquent, but it&#39;s as good a place as any for me to write about things I work on, care about or don&#39;t care about at all. If the result is that it ends up being is something I look back at and laugh about, well that&#39;s fine. No promises on what I&#39;ll write about, probably mainly <code>codey</code> things (sorry), and maybe some music stuff too - e.g. what I&#39;m listening to at the moment (a whole bunch of <a href="http://www.ladisputemusic.com/"><strong><code>La Dispute</code></strong></a> - their particular blend of anger/desperation really strikes a dischord with me at the moment) &amp; what I&#39;m trying to avoid listening to. I occasionally get kinda bored and record covers and they will possibly end up on here too (sorry again). For now, I&#39;m going to focus on getting the various projects I did at uni on here, and will probably write a bit more about them too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on <a href="https://twitter.com/phenomnominal"><strong><code>Twitter</code></strong></a> etc., so if you want to tell me that I am an idiot, or that I&#39;m not, go for gold. And if you have any ideas for stuff for my site, tell me that too!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s hoping that I stick to this!</p>
