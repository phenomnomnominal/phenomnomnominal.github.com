Hey, I'm Craig - let's assume for now that if you're reading this, you probably know me somehow (and if not, **"Hi?"**) - and this is going to be my site, and my blog. It's currently on [**`Github`**](https://github.com/phenomnomnominal/phenomnomnominal.github.com), but I'll eventually move it to my own domain, probably...

So, who am I? Excellent question, not really sure. But "*what* am I?" is probably a bit easier to answer. I'm 24 and I live in Wellington, NZ. By day I work for [**`Trade Me`**](http://www.trademe.co.nz) as a front-end dev on [**`Trade Me Touch`**](http://touch.trademe.co.nz). By night, I pretty much just watch TV.

For now this site is **SUPER** beta. No WebGL, it's broke. On a mobile? Even more broke. But I'll get there. If something almost works, but is really broken, please let me know - or better yet, fix it yourself, like I said, it's all up on [**`Github`**](https://github.com/phenomnomnominal/phenomnomnominal.github.com).

I guess the theory is that I will write some words and put them up here. They probably won't be particularly eloquent, but it's as good a place as any for me to write about things I work on, care about or don't care about at all. If the result is that it ends up being is something I look back at and laugh about, well that's fine. No promises on what I'll write about, probably mainly `codey` things (sorry), and maybe some music stuff too - e.g. what I'm listening to at the moment (a whole bunch of La Dispute - their particular blend of anger/desperation really strikes a dischord with me at the moment) & what I'm trying to avoid listening to. I occasionally get kinda bored and record covers and they will possibly end up on here too (sorry again). For now, I'm going to focus on getting the various projects I did at uni on here, and will probably write a bit more about them too.

I'm on [**`Twitter`**](https://twitter.com/phenomnominal) etc., so if you want to tell me that I am an idiot, or that I'm not, go for gold. And if you have any ideas for stuff for my site, tell me that too!

Here's hoping that I stick to this!
